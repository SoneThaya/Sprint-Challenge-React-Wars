  React is a javasscript framework. DOM operations causes performance issues. React solves the problem by not reloading the entire page. Just state and components that need the change of state.

2. Describe component state.

  State is an object that represents the parts of the app that can change. Each component can maintain its own state.

  Props is a special keyword in React, stands for properties and is used to pass data from one component to another. Props are passed in a uni-directional flow.

4. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to changes of certain state or props?

  The effect hook lets you perform side effects in function components that updates the document title right after react makes changes to the dom.
